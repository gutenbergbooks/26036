<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>A poet that comes through a unique experience,
as so many poets have, and very recently
as the author of this volume has, arrives through
his personality rather than his work at a precipitate
sort of fame that may serve his talents well
or serve them ill. To know that a man was sent
to jail as the consequence of a passionate desire
to go to college, and that that desire involved the
tramping of dusty and hungry miles, adds to the
interest to the man that cannot fail in some significant
way to set a glamor upon the poet. Poetry
is made out of experience&mdash;the experience of
dreams, of action, of desires and hopes baffled
on the inexplicable sea of circumstance; in these
latter the dream is as the spirit, and the man
whose art becomes an expression of all he has
realized in living, his experiences become something
more than art, they are the subtle rendering
reality that is truth.</p>

<p>In these poems of Mr. Jones' it is that which
gives them a unique value because they are in a
deeply essential manner the rendering of a human
document, as all poems must be, of an individual
who speaks universally. I emphasize this quality
first because art registers its worth by the vitality
of its substance. If the substance be vital, then
its embodiment is artistically successful to the
degree in which the maker has felt his experiences.
These poems, then, will come to many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-006" id="Page_p-006"></a></span>
readers with a freshness, with the appeal for a
certain sympathy that will compel attention.
The opening poem which celebrates the centenary
of Lincoln's birth, with its fine imaginative
sweep, is as good as any poem I have seen which
that occasion called forth. In it is poetry that
ought to assure Mr. Jones' future if circumstances
permit him to cultivate an art for which
nature has so obviously endowed him. "The
Sylvan Cabin" in spirit may be said to characterize
the author's book; that upward striving
toward the ideal, which taking a personal expression
in his own experience, in his own hopes, has
also a larger significance in voicing the aspirations
of those for whom, as is shown in many
other poems, he becomes a voice, a representative.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones' work has already won for him
the approbation of many literary people, his
poems having appeared from time to time in
various publications; this fact not only justifies
his gathering them together in this volume, but
being so recognized must fill him with a certain
assurance for the future. To this I can only add
that, good as these are, they give us the hope
for better from one who ought certainly to go
on and upward.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O, fairest Dame of sylvan glades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We come to pay thee homage due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embrace thee softly and to kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lovely, long-forsaken cheeks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smooth thy flowing silver locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bind about thy snowy neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A necklace golden studded full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rarest gems and shining pearls.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our eyes, though sometimes dimmed with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In purer lustre sparkle forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er they fall agaze on thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ears attuned to thy sweet lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch every flowing, cadent note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear it ever safe within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our rapturous hearts, which gladly leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er thy name is called!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-010" id="Page_p-010">[Pg 010]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in our souls the quenchless fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love full brightly burns upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred altar, set apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sprite commune and sacrifice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose high-priest tends with loving care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unto thee sweet incense burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our tongues most gladly sing thy praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from it ne'er shall cease&mdash;till all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land be free!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A century lonely hast thou stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here all forsaken and forgot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men failed thee to visit save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some idle lover of sylvan haunts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who trod, perchance, this hallowed spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast a pensive eye upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This lovely glade, thy sole abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Full lost in these continuous woods),<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-011" id="Page_p-011">[Pg 011]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And brooding o'er thy lowly lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft thus did muse: "This cabin lone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stands to tell the tale of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back-woodsman brave, who having scaled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystic mountains ne'er returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them, though loved yet left behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here he chose his last abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These gloomy woods whose blackness stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up hard against horizon's slope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grim, spectral, dreaded, and untrod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save monsters great of savage mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That prowled, or crouched upon their prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent forth a vicious roar that fairly shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Sylvia far and near, from vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through crag to mountain peak!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-012" id="Page_p-012">[Pg 012]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Upon this spot the redskin oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has danced his 'War dance' and his 'Feast,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face a reddish hue aglow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long locks with eaglets' plumes bedecked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bow and never-failing dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scalper dangling at his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More brightly gleamed his wary eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As braves the war-whoop loudly yelled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sight more like the fiery fiends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Pluto's ghastly shore returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than human blood and bone!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They all have gone and left no tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But woe which hurled them ever hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that shore whence no bark returns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Cabin, thou, a land-mark art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human progress' steady march!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For man in his pedantic art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soars far in feeble flights of song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Nature's heart, and thus he fails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Nature's God to hold commune!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bard has slept, dreamed many a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But failed to dream one dream of thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High hangs his lyre on willow reed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sitting 'neath yon shady nook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fails to catch one note of thy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal song that fills the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awake, O bard, from sleep so deep!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The song by Nature's vesper choir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the countless ages sung,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still is singing day by day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the world will join thy sweet<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After years of patient study and historical research, I
have made the following deductions of parts played by the
Ethiopian in the annals of history, under the caption, "An
Ode to Ethiopia." It is true that questions will rise regarding
the racial identity of some of my characters, in
view of historical statements which place them with the
Caucasian race; yet I firmly believe, were impartial history
written, my claims would be justified. However, Time,
the great Arbiter, will finally decide the equity of my
claims.</p></div>

<h2><a name="O_GOD_WILT_THOU_HELP_ME_IN_SCHOOL" id="O_GOD_WILT_THOU_HELP_ME_IN_SCHOOL"></a>O GOD, WILT THOU HELP ME IN SCHOOL?</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>On Saturday, March 1, 1902, I left Alcorn and went
home in order to earn money enough to defray my expenses
for the year 1902-03. I began work as soon as I
reached home and labored on father's farm until the last
week in June, 1902. I had seen by that time that there
was nothing to be realized from that source but disheartening
failure.</p>

<p>I then acted as agent for the "Zion Record," published
by Rev. R. A. Adams, 39 St. Catherine Street, Natchez,
Miss., until August 20, 1902. Knowing that there was a
dormitory to be built for girls at Alcorn, I went there,
hoping to get work and to be there when school opened.
On arriving, I failed to get employment. I had no money.
The Boarding Hall was run by boys who stayed over summer.
Finding I was unemployed, they refused to let me
take meals with them. There I was&mdash;friendless and
penniless&mdash;without a bite of bread and nowhere to lay my
head. To drive the wolf of starvation away and to keep
from being devoured, I made arrangements with President
Lanier to cut wood for something to eat, until school
opened Sept. 2, 1902.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-077" id="Page_p-077">[Pg 077]</a></span></p>

<p>When school opened, the Faculty met the first day and
distributed the positions to the eligibles. On going down
to the Hall to take my first meal, to my surprise I found
I had been awarded the position of waiter. To hold a
position, or even remain on the Campus, one must matriculate
within three days after school starts, if there when it
opens, or after he arrives, if not. I then wrote home for
the matriculation fee ($13), as I had labored there all
summer. As that letter was sealed my destiny was sealed
in it. It was one that hauled my anchor of hope; yes,
one to bring glad tidings of great joy and crowning success,
or the gloom of disastrous failure. Thus, having my
hope sealed, I wrote across it "In Haste!"</p>

<p>The night of its return was a dark, rainy one. As all
sat discussing different events that had transpired since the
new session had begun, suddenly a whistle was heard.
How our hearts throbbed with gladness as we exclaimed,
"There, that's the mail!" Dear reader, you cannot
imagine how overjoyed I was. I knew that bag contained
a letter for me; so anxious was I to receive it I did not
trust anyone, but rushed to the office, and ere long my
name was called.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p-078" id="Page_p-078">[Pg 078]</a></span></p>

<p>I opened it then and there, with an eager look for a
green piece of paper styled a "Money Order." I looked,
but found it not. All hope vanished; joy faded; and
gloom hovered over me&mdash;a feeling I never before had, nor
since, and I hope never again to have, electrified my body.
It was then raining at full headway: the lightnings flashed;
the thunders pealed out peal after peal, each succeeding
one louder than the first. By this time all had gone to
bed but me. I thought thought after thought, prayed
prayer after prayer, sent up cry after cry, shed tear after
tear. I went to bed, but could not sleep. I then thought
of this subject: "O God, Wilt Thou Help Me in School?"
